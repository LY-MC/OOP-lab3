I created root class Entity, then I created three child classes: Person, Animal and Cage.
From the Person class I created two child classes: Client and ZooWorker.
From Client: Child and Adult.
From ZooWorker: Cashier, Zookeeper, Veterinarian, SecurityGuard.
From Animal: Duck, Horse, Lion, Elephant, Monkey.
From Cage: CageWithLake.
